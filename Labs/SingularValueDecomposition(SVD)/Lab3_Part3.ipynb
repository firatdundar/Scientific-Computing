    "_In the previous part of the lab, we learned how to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix in Python. But what methods are used under the hood? In this part we look at two numerical methods used for eigenvalue computations. From mathematics, you know that eigenvalues can be computed via the characteristic equation  ùëëùëíùë°(ùê¥‚àíùúÜùêº)=0 . This is not an option in software though, since the coefficients of the characteristic equation can't be computed from determinant evaluations in a numerically stable way. It leads to large perturbations in the roots. In this lab, we will have a look at some computational methods to calculate the eigenvalues of a matrix._ "
